# Voice-Interaction-App-using-LLM
The Voice Interaction Application is a web-based solution that processes audio input through Google's Vertex AI platform using the Gemini-1.5-pro model. The application serves two primary functions: 
1. Audio transcription from either uploaded files or direct recordings 
2. Sentiment and content analysis of the transcribed audio 
3. The application stands out for its efficient use of a single LLM API call to handle both transcription and analysis tasks, optimizing both performance and cost.
